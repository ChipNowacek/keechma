# Keechma

Keechma is an attempt to formalize solutions to most common problems in frontend application development. It is implemented in ClojureScript, using the [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) library, and is heavily inspired by [Re/Frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame). 

All parts are built in modular, decoupled way, but together they allow you to write apps that have the following properties:

- Data based routing
- Unidirectional data flow
- Decoupled UI
- Entity store
- Memory safety
- Lifecycle hooks

> Kičma (lat. columna vertebralis) is a Croatian word for backbone / spine.

Yes, it’s a nod to BackboneJS and SpineJS.
